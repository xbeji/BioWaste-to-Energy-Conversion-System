# BioWaste-to-Energy Conversion System

This repository contains the Python code for simulating the working principle of the BioWaste-to-Energy Conversion System. The system includes components for organic waste collection, biogas production, and electricity generation.

## Code Overview

### Classes:

1. **OrganicWasteCollector:**
   - This class represents the collection of organic waste.
   - `collect_waste`: Method to collect organic waste.

2. **AnaerobicDigester:**
   - Simulates the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production.
   - `produce_biogas`: Method to produce biogas based on the amount of organic waste.

3. **BiogasGenerator:**
   - Represents the generation of electricity from biogas.
   - `generate_electricity`: Method to generate electricity based on the amount of biogas.

### Sample Simulation:

```python
# Sample simulation
organic_waste_collector = OrganicWasteCollector()
anaerobic_digester = AnaerobicDigester()
biogas_generator = BiogasGenerator()

# Collect organic waste
organic_waste_collector.collect_waste(['food scraps', 'agricultural residues', 'green waste'])

# Produce biogas
biogas_produced = anaerobic_digester.produce_biogas(organic_waste_collector.collected_waste)

# Generate electricity from biogas
biogas_generator.generate_electricity(biogas_produced)

print(f"Electricity generated: {biogas_generator.electricity_generated} kWh")
```
